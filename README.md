# Migration Patterns of GPS-Tracked Birds

## Introduction

The wonders of bird migration have captivated scientists and bird enthusiasts alike for centuries. With advancements in GPS tracking technology, we now have the unprecedented ability to study these migratory patterns in fine detail. This notebook presents an analysis of GPS tracking data for three birds to understand their migratory behavior along the coast.

As a Geospatial Data Scientist, I aim to translate complex datasets into meaningful insights, presenting the information in an accessible way to non-experts. The analysis covers several key aspects of bird migration:

- **Travel Distance**: Estimating the total distance each bird has traveled during the study period.
- **Migration Routes**: Mapping the routes taken by each bird and exploring additional insights to understand their migration behavior.
- **Temporal Patterns**: Identifying patterns in the timing of flights to determine when birds are most likely to travel.
- **Stopping Points**: Pinpointing locations where birds stop, which could indicate resting or feeding behavior.

The insights gleaned from this study will not only contribute to our understanding of avian migration but also support strategic decisions in conservation efforts and planning, especially as we work closely with clients in the domain.

By leveraging advanced geospatial data processing, we endeavor to provide a clear picture of the migration patterns, and thereby, lay the groundwork for innovative solutions in the sectors reliant on such pivotal information.
